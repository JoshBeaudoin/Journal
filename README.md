# Journal
*MARCH 14th- Today we started doing figma mock up designs. i like this part of the class because its pretty cool getting to design the stuff out my self and plan where it would all go. We drafted a homepage today which was kind of cool it was a first step kind of thing to this new design.
*MARCH 16th- Today we started learning about VUEjs which is super hard for me i am having a little bit of a problem figuring things out with it but im kind of starting to get it. i dont really know too much about all this kind of things so its quite hard learning this all brand new but i will just keep practicing with it until things work.
*MARCH 18th- Today we didnt have regular class but a career constoltin class where they just kind of teach you how to get a job, what jobs look for and like how to act in the workspace. This class is more a buffer class through the week which i believe the program makes you take as a class that doesnt have anything to do with this course.
MARCH 22nd- Today this journal is already late but i started to come back from my medical appoinentments, i finished all the work i had to i believe i completed the webpage and the proto types for all of them which is pretty good.
